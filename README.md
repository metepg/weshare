# Weshare

- App for splitting bills between 2 users.
- Built with Spring Boot (Java 21) / Angular 18 / Flyway / PostgreSQL.
- Runs in browser and is styled just enough to look good with my current phone.
- I built this because MobilePay discontinued their own app Weshare at the start of 2023. This app is intended for my personal use only as it is hardcoded for 2 people but feel free to do whatever you want with it.
- Using this repository to try out Testcontainers for integration tests and local development.
