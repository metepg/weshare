# Weshare

- App for splitting bills between 2 users.
- Built with Spring Boot (Java 21) / Angular 19 / Flyway / PostgreSQL.
- Runs in browser and is styled just enough to look good with my current phone.
- I built this because MobilePay discontinued their own app Weshare at the start of 2023. This app is intended for my personal use only as it is hardcoded for 2 people but feel free to do whatever you want with it.
- Using this repository to try out Testcontainers for integration tests and local development.

# Development

Requires Docker / Podman daemon to be running.

Run these to start the app for development.

`project root`:
```sh
./mvnw -f server/pom.xml spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev
```

`client` directory
```sh
npm start

# IMPORTANT FOR WINDOWS USERS
# Before starting client you need to change paths in package.json
# from ./node/node to .\\node\\node etc..
```

Insert users and test data by running this from project root `docker exec -i weshare_db psql -U postgres -d weshare < server/src/main/resources/db/create-test-data.sql`

- **User 2:**
  - Username: `user2`
  - Password: `password`
